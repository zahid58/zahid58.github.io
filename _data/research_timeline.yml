  abstract: Automatically detecting violence from surveillance footage is a subset of activity recognition that deserves special attention because of its wide applicability in unmanned security monitoring systems, internet video filtration, etc. In this work, we propose an efficient two-stream deep learning architecture leveraging Separable Convolutional LSTM (SepConvLSTM) and pre-trained MobileNet where one stream takes in background suppressed frames as inputs and other stream processes difference of adjacent frames.

  abstract: Bangla is one of the worldâ€™s top ten popular languages in terms of the num- ber of speakers. It also happens to have a complex script primarily because of the presence of complex characters e.g. graphemes, that are composed of multiple single characters, and the characteristic shorthands e.g. vowel dia- critics, and consonant diacritics, making the number of classes of this script recognition quite large, varied and challenging. In this paper, we present a unique large-scale Bangla document OCR solution based on character-level recognition modules.

- title: A Comparative Analysis of Efficient Convolutional Neural Network Based Methods for Plant Disease Classification
  authors: Ridwan Mahbub, Samiha Anuva, Ifrad Khan, Zahidul Islam
  jorc: 2022 25th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT)
  abstract: For implementation of automated mechanisms to detect and classify plant disease, using heavy-weight convolutional neural network or CNN-driven solutions is often not practical as farmers are not equipped with devices capable of running such heavy applications. This is why lightweight CNN architectures capable of operating mobile and embedded devices are crucial. In this work, we present a comparative analysis and overview of different efficient CNN-based methodologies proposed for plant disease classification. Moreover, we fine-tuned off-the-shelf state-of-the-art efficient CNN architectures using transfer learning to analyze and determine the right balance of model size and accuracy.

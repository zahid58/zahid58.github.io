description: Presented two papers at NeurIPS 2024 in the workshop on Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). The first paper presents an unsupervised method for video highlight detection capitalizing on repeating patterns in audio and visual modalities of similar videos. The second work proposes a meta-learning-based test-time adaptation approach to handle distribution shifts at test-time.

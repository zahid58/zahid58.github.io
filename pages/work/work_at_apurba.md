<h2><b>My Works</b> at Apurba Tech</h2>
</div>
<hr/>
<h7 style="text-align: justify;">Apurba technologies Inc is a USA-based software development company, with regional offices in Bangladesh and Malaysia, that creates enterprise big data solutions using NLP, machine learning, and Computer Vision.
</h7>
<br/>
<h7 style="text-align: justify;">I joined Apurba as a Machine Learning Engineer (Computer Vision) and was assigned to Bangla Optical Character Recognition Project which was delegated by Bangladesh ICT Ministry. The goal of this project was a build a complete Bangla OCR Engine deployable online with integrated handwriting recognition system.
</h7>
<br/>

During my time at Apurba, I was mainly involved with -
<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Research and development of large-scale Bengali Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines.</li>
  <li>Developed and optimized deep learning models for grapheme-based bengali character recognition.</li>
  <li>Implemented image processing & deep learning methods for word detection & character segmentation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 align="left"><b>Bangla Word Detection</b></h3>
<br/>

<ul>
  <li>Improved word detection in the OCR pipeline by replacing image processing algorithm with a deep learning based solution leveraging EAST neural network.</li>
  <li>Modified EAST with custom CNN such as Mobilenets and fine-tuned it for Bangla Printed and Hand-written text documents.</li>
  <li>The model takes a document image as input and outputs bounding boxes for each word in the document.</li><br/>
</ul>

<h7 style="text-align: justify;">Apurba technologies Inc is a USA-based software development company, with regional offices in Bangladesh and Malaysia, that creates enterprise big data solutions using NLP, machine learning, and Computer Vision.
<br/>
I joined Apurba as a Machine Learning Engineer (Computer Vision) and was assigned to Bangla Optical Character Recognition Project which was delegated by Bangladesh ICT Ministry. The goal of this project was a build a complete Bangla OCR Engine deployable online with integrated handwriting recognition system.

<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Research and development of large-scale Bengali Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines.</li>
  <li>Developed and optimized deep learning models for grapheme-based bengali character recognition.</li>
  <li>Implemented image processing & deep learning methods for word detection & character segmentation.</li>
</ul>

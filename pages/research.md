<hr/>
<h7 align="justify">I am interested in doing research in the fields of Computer Vision, Machine Learning/ Deep Learning. My final year undergraduate thesis was on "Automatic detection of violence from surveillance footage" (Published in IJCNN 2021). During this time, I got to explore the impactful and diversified field of Vision. I intend to produce more works in this field.</h7>

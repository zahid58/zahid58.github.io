<h2><b>Research</b> Experience</h2>
</div>
<hr/>
<h7 style="text-align: justify;">My research interests lie in the domain of <b>Computer Vision</b>, <b>Machine Learning</b> and their <b>real-world applications</b>. I am particularly interested in human behavior and activity recognition, object detection and video understanding. Since my final year undergraduate thesis on "Automatic Violence Detection from Surveillance Footage" (Published in IJCNN 2021), I am exploring the diverse and impactful research are of Computer Vision. I intend to produce more works in this field.</h7>

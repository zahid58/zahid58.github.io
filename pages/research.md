<br/>
<h7 style="text-align: justify;">As an MSc student at the University of Saskatchewan (USask), I am currently conducting research in Computer Vision and Deep Learning with Dr. Mrigank Rochan. Our research works have been accepted to be presented at reputed venues such as IEEE WACV 2025, and NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Self-Supervised Learning. My undergrad research work on “Violent Activity Recognition” was published at IJCNN 2021 and has gained over 77 citations so far. In addition to my academic experiences, I have also gained exposure at the industry while working as a Machine Learning Engineer at Apurba Technologies. I contributed to developing a large-scale Bengali OCR system for text recognition. Additionally, developing various academic and personal projects related to computer graphics, computer vision, and machine learning have further enriched my technical expertise. </h7>
